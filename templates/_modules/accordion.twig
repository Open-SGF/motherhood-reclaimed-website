                According to statistical reports from
                <a href="https://fosteringcourtimprovement.org/mo/County/Greene/" target="_blank" rel=""noreferrer>
                    Greene County for Fostering Court Improvements
                </a>
                , as of March of 2020 there were 665 children in foster care in Greene County. This rate is
                equal to 104 per 10K, a rate higher than the state overall average of 88 per 10K. While
                <a href="http://www.akleg.gov/basis/get_documents.asp?session=30&docid=54225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                    research
                </a>
                indicates that “everyone agrees that the first goal is to reunite children and youth with their
                families as soon as possible,” rates of reunification still hover in Greene County, with less than
                half (42%) of all children removed from their parents’ custody ultimately being reunited
                with their parents. Overall, termination of parental rights within the first 15 months
                of a child coming into state care rates are more than three times higher in
                Greene County (59%) than they are in the State of Missouri’s overall (18%). The top
                three reasons for removal of children from their home and parents in Greene County are
                1) caretaker drug and alcohol use (55%), 2) neglect (49%), and 3) inadequate housing (27%).
                Motherhood Reclaimed believes that these are concerns that can be addressed and
                overcome with ongoing programming and support for parents.

                Children being removed from their parents' care has a large impact on the lives of these
                children and their mothers as well as a significant financial impact on the taxpayer burden.

                    Average taxpayers spend
                </a>
                about $300,000 on public assistance and incarceration costs, over the lifetime of each
                individual that ages out of the foster care system. From
                <a href="https://fosteringcourtimprovement.org/mo/County/Greene" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                    April 2019 through March 2020, 22 children in Greene County care were discharged through emancipation.
                </a>
                Using cost estimates of $300,000 in public assistance needed to support these
                individuals, in this one year period alone, these 22 children will cost
                taxpayers $6.6 million over their lifetime. Spending money on reunification of children and
                their mothers not only reduces trauma for the child and mother but also saves taxpayers money.
